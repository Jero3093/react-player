    I remember when I saw you
    You know I couldn't look away
    You're the spark that starts the fire
    Tell me, do you feel the same?
    
    So give me one more shot tonight
    I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
    Let me show you that the only thing I know
    No matter where we go
    I feel just like I did when we connected
    Feeling electric
    Feeling electric
    
    You can tell me all your secrets
    I would never tell a soul
    I'll make a promise and I'll keep it
    I would never let you go
    
    So give me one more shot tonight
    I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
    Let me show you that the only thing I know
    No matter where we go
    I feel just like I did when we connected
    Feeling electric
    Feeling electric, oh

    The only thing I know
    No matter where we go
    I feel just like I did when we connected
    Feeling electric
    
    So give me one more shot tonight
    I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
    Let me show you that the only thing I know
    No matter where we go
    I feel just like I did when we connected
    Feeling electric
    Feeling electric, oh
    
    The only thing I know
    No matter where we go
    I feel just like I did when we connected

    After the blackout there was darkness in the streets
    The only light for miles and miles shined artificially
    It looks like tech this time
    No way to mask the lack of spine
    Don't mess with Ninjago cuz we'll get you every time!

    Hey! Then the lights came on
    Brighter than ever before
    Can you see them shine?
    Go ninja! Go go Ninja!
    Won't let them fade
    This city's meant for much more!
    Gonna hear us shout
    Go ninja! Go go Ninja!

    STOP GO
    NINJA, GO
    LIGHT UP
    NINJA, GO

    After the blackout I could finally see
    I knew the day would come when I would defend my home city
    It looks like now's the time
    That we should stand up for the fight
    This blackout's over and I'm ready for the light!

    Hey! Then the lights came on
    Brighter than ever before
    Can you see them shine?
    Go ninja! Go go Ninja!
    Won't let them fade
    This city's meant for much more!
    Gonna hear us shout
    Go ninja! Go go Ninja!

    STOP GO
    NINJA, GO
    LIGHT UP
    NINJA, GO!

    (Ninja, ninja)
    After the blackout
    After the blackout
    After the blackout
    After the blackout
    I am ready for the light!

    Hey! Then the lights came on
    Brighter than ever before
    Can you see them shine?
    Go ninja! Go go Ninja!
    Won't let them fade
    This city's meant for much more!

    lyrics: `
    I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboards
    But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
    Another evening, I'll be sitting reading in-between your lines
    Because I miss you all the time

    So, get away
    Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
    And let yourself go
    You know you didn't lose your self-control
    Let's start at the rainbow
    Turn away
    Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
    And let yourself go
    Is that a compromise?

    So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
    There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
    A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
    I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
    'Cause I really wanna stay at your housе
    And I hopе this works out
    But you know how much you broke me apart
    I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you, I don't wanna know

    And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
    'Cause I did everything to be there by your si-i-ide
    So, when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
    And why do I still want to call you? (Call you, call you, call you)

    So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
    There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
    A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
    I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
    'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
    And I hopе this works out
    But you know how much you broke me apart
    I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you, I don't wanna know

    You
    Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
    I don't know where I'm going

    So, get away
    Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
    And let yourself go
    You know you didn't lose your self-control
    Let's start at the rainbow
    Turn away
    Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
    And let yourself go
    Is that a compromise?

    So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?

    I only miss you when it rains
    And when I listen to the radio
    Go past your station on the train
    And then I'll think of you
    Can't help but think of you
    Seasons change and I remember
    How you loved me like September
    Time goes by and I pretend that
    That I don't think of you
    I only miss you when I open my eyes
    And I breathe and I try to forget
    That I let you go
    I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
    Try to sleep and I cry
    To forget that I let you go
    I only miss you when I open my eyes
    And I breathe and I try to forget
    That I let you go
    I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
    Try to sleep and I cry
    To forget that I let you go
    I only miss you when

    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
    I only miss you when
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
    Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
    I never talk about you now
    I hear you're happy and that's hard to know
    I sometimes wander past your house
    Because I think of you
    I always think of you
    Seasons change and I remember
    How you loved me like September
    Time goes by and I pretend that
